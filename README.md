I like code, coffee, and tech. â˜•
<br/><br/>
I like to share my passions with others which is why I link to everything everywhere. I'm open to freelance projects if you have an iOS app that needs some work. Shoot me an <a href = "mailto: freelance@cctplus.dev">email</a> and we can start discussions.

# Current Projects

Here are some projects I'm currently working on.

| Project Name | Description | Platform(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [iHog](https://github.com/maeganwilson/iHog4) | App to control Hog 4 consoles over OSC | iOS and iPadOS |
| [CoffeeToast](https://github.com/maeganwilson/CoffeeToast) | Swift package to add toast notifcations | Xcode | 
| [Fixture Universe](https://github.com/maeganwilson/artnet-converter)| App to calculate the fixture universe number from the artnet subnet and universe numbers | iOS and iPadOS |

These projects are my main focus.

# Stats

I also like arbitrary numbers with no context, so here are some that kind of represent me.
