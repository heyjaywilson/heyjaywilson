I like to solve problems using Swift as much as possible and am always eager to share what I'm working on and learning. my YouTube channel is where I get to dive deeper into some thoughts I have around my career, engineering, and life. Occasionally, I'll put out a tutorial about something cool in code. Generally I save the code explanations for my Twitch streams where I build my personal apps and tools live.
