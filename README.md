```swift
public struct AboutMe {
    let name = "Jay"
    var pronouns = ["they","them"]
    
    let profession = "iOS Engineer @ Matter Neuroscience"
    
    var preferredTechStack = ["swift", "swiftui", "cloudkit", "core data"]
    var hasUsed = ["react", "javascript", "firebase"]
}
```

I like to solve problems using Swift as much as possible and am always eager to share what I'm working on and learning both on my YouTube and on my Twitch chanels.
