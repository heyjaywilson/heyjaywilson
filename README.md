I like code, coffee, and tech. â˜•
<br/><br/>
I like to share my passions with others which is why I link to everything everywhere. I'm open to freelance projects if you have an iOS app or web app that needs some work. Shoot me an <a href = "mailto: freelance@cctplus.xyz">email</a> and we can start discussions.

# Current Projects

Here are some projects I'm currently working on.

| Project Name | Description | Platform(s) | GitHub Repo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iHog | App to control Hog 4 consoles over OSC | iOS and iPadOS | [Link](https://github.com/maeganwilson/iHog4)|
| Fixture Universe | App to calculate the fixture universe number from the artnet subnet and universe numbers | iOS and iPadOS | [Link](https://github.com/maeganwilson/artnet-converter) |

These projects are my main focus. Make sure to check out my repo list for all the other incomplete projects that I start and have full intention to finish at somepoint and time in life.

# Stats

I also like arbitrary numbers with no context, so here are some that kind of represent me.
