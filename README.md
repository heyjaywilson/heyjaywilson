I like code, coffee, and tech. â˜•
<br/><br/>
I like to share my passions with others which is why I link to everything everywhere. I'm open to freelance projects if you have an iOS app or web app that needs some work. Shoot me an <a href = "mailto: freelance@cctplus.xyz">email</a> and we can start discussions.

# Stats

I also like arbitrary numbers with no context, so here are some that kind of represent me.

# Find me on the web

I have a website where I post at least once a week about something related to software development and or tech in general.

If you like what I do and want to support me, then consider buying me a cup of coffee.
